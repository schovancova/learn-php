1  Write a short script which will print current time, wait for 1 minute and print the time again
2  Write an infinite script which will print the time every second (interrupt using Ctrl+C in command line)
3  Write a script which will print a random number from 0 to 50 (check http://php.net/manual/en/function.rand.php)
4  Write an infinite script which will print a different random number every second
5  Modify the previous program, so it also prints the verbal information whether the random number is greater or lower than 500
6  Write a similar program, which prints the number only if it is divisible by 3 (use operator modulo, N % M)
7  Write a similar program, which prints the number only if it is bigger then the digit representing the number of seconds of the current time.
8  Write a program which generates a random number from 0 to 50 every second. When the number is greater than 40, it prints it and finishes (use break; statement).
9  Write a similar program. It finishes if the number equals to the digit representing the number of seconds of the time when it was started.
