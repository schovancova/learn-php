Create a function which transforms the number into a currency code: 1 = GBP, 2 = USD, 3 = EUR (these values are hard-coded in the function body, use if/elseif/elseif, switch or associative array and key-value lookup).
Use the function from above in the program from our last lesson, which reads product data from the CSV.
Use the same function in the program which reads the product info from the API.
Finish your homework from last lessons (ideally doing (or at least trying) optional assignments as well).
Use functions where applicable. That includes cross-task functionality, such as "modify the previous program..."
Also, modify your already completed and submitted programs from the last lesson, so there is no unnecessary code duplication.
